*My other README introduction is way too long and nerdy. So I'm in the process of writing this one, which ought to be more like a short pitch of the idea.*
*(I also have to shorten the long version as well.)*


### Short description

This project wants to create a website—and a browser extension—where users can rate all kinds of resources according to arbitrary predicates!


### The existing technology 

Existing [folksonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy) systems allow users to add [tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)) to the various resources on the given site. This then makes it possible for other users to get a quick overview of the qualities of a given resource, which is advantageous when you want to search for a thing (e.g. a movie, video, article, book, recipe, etc.) that best matches their interests.

However, existing systems only allow users to see *if* a given resource is has a certain quality or not; they do not allow the users to see *how much* it fits that quality!

For instance, if you are looking for scary movie to watch, you might be able to get a list of all the movies that carries the 'scary' tag on a conventional site. But you cannot see *how* scary any given movie is, to match the degree that you are searching for.

### Ratable tags

So how about system that allows the users to rate each tag on a scale so that each user can then tailor their searches and get their feeds sorted after exactly the qualities that they are looking for?

This project believes that there is a giant possibility here for improving user experience and utility of websites.

### A few more examples that illustrate the idea

To give some other examples, imagine that you are looking for an article about a subject, and you want to find one that is both very educational and also somewhat entertaining. Then you could take those two tags, 'educational' and 'entertaining' and combine it with an overall rating of how 'liked' the resource is. And by giving a lot of weight (adjusted by some slider) to the 'educational' rating, and a little weight as well to the 'entertaining' rating, you get get these kinds of resources listed first in the search feed.

For each resource in such a search feed, you can then also immediately see the score for each of the tags used in your search, such that you can pick out the one that matches your preferences best.

Another example could be searching for products or services to buy or subscribe to. ...

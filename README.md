# openSDB (prototype)

## Summary

openSDB is an open source Semantic Database, interfaced through a web
application, which I intend to host at [...] once it is ready.

The term 'semantic' here refers to the fact that the data is structured in terms
of subject-relation-object connections, much similar to core concepts of the
Semantic Web, a vision proposed by Tim Berners-Lee (see e.g.
[www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) or [www.w3.org/RDF/Metalog/docs/sw-easy](https://www.w3.org/RDF/Metalog/docs/sw-easy)).

And in fact, this project actually hopes to breathe new life into this vision,
and hopefully be able to lay the way for a new web: the Semantic Web.

But now we are getting ahead of ourselves. The first goal of openSDB should not
be to revolutionize how the web is used. The first goal should be create at
least just one useful application of a Semantic Database (SDB), and then prove
its usefulness by being able to attract a significant number of users.

Now, I have a lot applications in mind for this SDB that I think could
potentially attract users once they are built, and which I do not expect will
take me too long to build (even on my own). But there is definitely one ...

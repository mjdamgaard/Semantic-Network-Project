## Any help is appreciated!

If you think that this project sounds interesting and you want to support it in
any way, also including simply giving some comments and points of critique,
please feel free to contact me, if not via GitHub then on my e-mail at
fxn318@alumni.ku.dk.

As of the time of writing, I am only one person working on this project, but I
really hope to attract some others soon who could be interested in joining it
in any capacity.

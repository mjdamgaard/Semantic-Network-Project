## Any help is appreciated

If you think that this project sounds interesting and you want to support it in
any way, also including simply giving some comments to it, please feel free to
contact me, if not via GitHub then on my e-mail at fxn318@alumni.ku.dk.

And please do contact me if you want to help me turn those "I"s in the
[README](https://github.com/mjdamgaard/openSDB/blob/master/README_longer_version.md)
into "we"s instead. :smiley:

<h3>Lesson 0</h3>
<p>
    Open <a href="index.php">this website</a> in a new tab such that you can
    easily switch between this tutorial tab on one where you try out the site.
</p>
<p>
    Note that you can switch easily between tabs using Ctrl+Tab, especially if
    you have only two tabs open.
    (If using a mobile device, this might not be quite as easy, but its ...)
</p>
<p>
    The following action suggestions will all
</p>
<p>
    Press the plus and minus buttons in the navigation bar (next to the
    Tutorial button) and see what it means for the number of columns on the
    screen.
</p>
<p>
    (If using a very thin screen, this might not work, sorry. In that case
    forget these plus and minus buttons for now, or go to a computer instead.)
</p>
<p>
    Try to open some columns by clicking on the various links in the columns.
</p>
<p>
    Try to open more columns than can fit inside the screen at once and then
    cycle through them using either the left and right arrow keys or by clicking
    the margins of the page (with the arrow symbols in them).

<h3>Lesson 1</h3>
<p>
    First create an account. (You can use a fake e-mail address to make a
    temporary account for testing purposes.) Click on 'Sign Up' and fill out
    the form.
</p>
<p>
    View the initial column with the title "Entities." This is the fundamental
    entity in the database which represents the category of all entities
    (including itself). It is the "category of all things" in other words.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the 'Full title' says: "Category ▸ Entities." This means that the
    entity in question is of the type "Category."
</p>
<p>
    In the Subcategories tab, select the category called "Music" (by clicking
    on that word).
</p>
<p>
    Note that its 'Full title' says: "Category ▸ Music," This entity thus
    represents the category of things related to music.
</p>
<p>
    In the Subcategories tab of the "Music" column, select "Rock" (by clicking
    on that word).
</p>
<p>
    Note that its 'Full title' says: "Category ▸ Rock (Music)." The parentheses
    are thus used here to disambiguate what "Rock" refers to. It refers to the
    genre of music, not to stone, nor to a certain kind of motion, nor to a tool
    used for spinning.
</p>


<h3>Lesson 2</h3>
<p>
    Resume or repeat lesson 1 such that you have opened the "Category ▸ Rock
    (Music)" entity.
</p>
<p>
    Note that under its ID, it says: "Template: {&lt;Title&gt;}
    (&lt;Supercategory&gt;)."

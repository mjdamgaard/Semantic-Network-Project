<h1>Tutorial</h1>

<h2>Lession 0</h2>
<p>
    Press the plus and minus buttons in the navigation bar (next to the
    Tutorial button) and see what it means for the number of columns on the
    screen.

    (If using a very thin screen, click the minus button while on this tutorial
    page to get only one column on the screen.)

    Try to open some columns by clicking on the various links in the columns.

    Try to open more columns than can fit inside the screen at once and then
    cycle through them using either the left and right arrow keys or by clicking
    the margins of the page (with the arrow symbols in them).

<h2>Lession 1</h2>
<p>
    First create an account. (You can use a fake e-mail address to make a
    temporary account for testing purposes.) Click on 'Sign Up' and fill out
    the form.

    Once this is done, refresh the page to get only one column called
    "Entities."

    This is the fundamental entity in the database which represents the
    category of all entities in the database. It is the "category of all things"
    in other words.

    Note that the 'Full title' says: "Category â–¸ Entities." This means that the
    entity in question is of the type "Category" and has the title "Entities".

    In the Subcategories tab, select the category called "Music" (by clicking
    on that word).

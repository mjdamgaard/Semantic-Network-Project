## Styles

So far, I have implemented the style of this prototype with the
ContentLoader.addCSS() method, which I made for various reasons, none of which
really matters at this early stage. But for anyone forking this repo, you don't
have to do the same at all.

Feel completely free to add your own styles in the conventional way, adding CSS
files. (Also feel free to add styles as similar JS style modules, if that seems
easier.)

In a future implementation, we can always just refactor so that the JS style
modules are transformed into CSS files as well. (And if it ever becomes
beneficial, we can also easily refactor the other way.)

TLDR: Add styles the way you like.

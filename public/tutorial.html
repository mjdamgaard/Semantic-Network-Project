<h3>About the website</h3>
<p>
    This website is open source! To view the source code (and to fork it!),
    visit <a href="https://github.com/mjdamgaard/openSDB">
    github.com/mjdamgaard/openSDB</a>.
</p>
<p>
    On that site, one can also read a description about the point of this
    website and the ideas behind it. (See the README.md.)
</p>
<p>
    So far, this website is just a prototype to showcase the idea. But it aims
    to grow into a proper Web 2.0 site, hopefully in a very near future.
</p>


<h3>About this tutorial</h3>
<p>
    The following action suggestions in this tutorial will all be things to do
    on the main page of this site, not this tutorial page. You will thus need
    to switch back and forth between this page and the main page in order to
    follow the tutorial.
</p>
<p>
    Tip:
    If using a computer (recommended), open <a href="index.php">this website</a>
    in a new tab such that you can easily switch between this tutorial tab on
    one where you try out the site. (Note that Ctrl+Tab switches easily between
    tabs, especially if you have only two tabs open.)
</p>
<p>
    An if you want a wider version of this tutorial, open
    <a href="tutorial.html">this link</a> in a new tab or new window.
</p>


<h3>Lesson 0</h3>
<p>
    Try to open some columns by clicking on the various links in the columns
    (on the main page).
</p>
<p>
    Press the plus and minus buttons in the navigation bar (next to the
    Tutorial button) and see what it means for the number of columns on the
    screen.
</p>
<p>
    (If using a very thin screen, this might not work, sorry. In that case
    forget these plus and minus buttons for now, or go to a computer instead.)
</p>
<p>
    Try to open more columns than can fit inside the screen at once and then
    cycle through them
    by clicking the margins of the page (with the arrow symbols in them).
</p>
<p>
    (Preferred number of columns for this tutorial: 3.)
</p>


<h3>Lesson 1</h3>
<p>
    View the initial column with the title 'Entities' and close all other
    columns (by pressing the close button in the top right of each column).
    If you have closed the 'Entities' column, press 'openSDB' in the top left
    of the page to add an 'Entities' column.
</p>
<p>
    Close this column such that you have zero columns open, then open it again
    by clicking on 'openSDB' in the top left of the page.
</p>
<p>
    Each column represents an <i>entity</i> in the database. And each entity
    is essentially a word: it <i>references something</i>, either some concrete
    object, place or person in the world, or a more abstract concept.
</p>
<p>
    The 'Entities' entity you have on your screen on the main page is an
    abstract entity that represents the category of all entities in the
    database (including itself).
    It is essentially the 'category of all things,' in other words.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the 'Full title' says: 'Category ▸ Entities.' This means that the
    entity in question is of the type 'Category.'
</p>
<p>
    In the 'Subcategories' tab, select the category called 'Music' (by clicking
    on that word).
</p>
<p>
    Note that its 'Full title' says: 'Category ▸ Music,' This entity thus
    represents the category of things related to music.
</p>
<p>
    In the Subcategories tab of the 'Music' column, select 'Rock' (by clicking
    on that word).
</p>
<p>
    Note that its 'Full title' says: 'Category ▸ Rock (Music).' The parentheses
    are thus used here to disambiguate what 'Rock' refers to. It refers to the
    genre of music, not to stone, nor to a certain kind of motion, nor to a tool
    used for spinning.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, go back to the 'Music' column and press the little downward
    arrowhead under 'Rock' in the Subcategories tab. Note that in the dropdown
    menu, one can also read the full title of this 'Rock' entity.
</p>


<h3>Lesson 2</h3>
<p>
    Create an account. (You can use a fake e-mail address to make a
    temporary account for testing purposes.) Click on 'Sign Up' and fill out
    the form.
</p>
<p>
    Resume or repeat lesson 1 such that you have opened the 'Category ▸ Rock
    (Music)' entity.
</p>
<p>
    Note that under its ID, it says: 'Template: {&lt;Title&gt;}
    (&lt;Supercategory&gt;).'
</p>
<p>
    Click on said text to open a new column for this template entity, whose
    full title can be seen to be: 'Template ▸ {&lt;Title&gt;}
    (&lt;Supercategory&gt;).' Note that the 'Template ▸' in front means that
    the entity is of the type 'Template.'
</p>
<p>
    A template like this is used to create entities whose semantics (i.e. their
    meaning) can depend on several individual parts. This particular template
    was used to create the 'Rock' category entity with 'Music' as its
    supercategory to disambiguate it from other possible interpretations of the
    word 'Rock.'
</p>
<p>
    Try to submit another entity with the title 'Rock,' but with another
    supercategory! This is done under the 'Submit entity' tab.
    For instance choose the supercategory 'Geology' to make the entity refer to
    stone rather than a genre of music. (Also type in 'Rock' in the title
    field.) Click submit to upload this entity.
</p>
<p>
    If you have remained logged-in, a new column should now have opened with
    your submitted entity! Although somebody else might have submitted this
    entity before you. Go back to the previous column where you clicked 'Submit'
    and read the text underneath the button. It should either say that the
    'Entity was successfully uploaded!' or that the 'Entity already exists'
    depending on whether or not you were the first one to upload it.
</p>
<p>
    You can also click 'Search' to search for the entity (without submitting
    it). Click 'Search' with the same values in the form. Now that we know that
    the relevant entity already exists, it will surely open it in a new column
    and write: 'Entity was found!'
</p>
<p>
    With one of the 'Rock (Geology)' columns open (if 'Geology' was what you
    chose), note that only the 'Category ▸' part of the full title is clickable.
    This is opposed to the 'Rock (Music)' column before, where 'Music' can be
    clicked to open the 'Music' column from before. (Try this.)
</p>
<p>
    In order to create (or search for) an entity where 'Geology' is also
    clickable in the full title, go to the 'Template ▸ {&lt;Title&gt;}
    (&lt;Supercategory&gt;)' column again and type in 'Rock' as the title again,
    but with '#89' (without the quotation marks) as the supercategory now.
    (#89 is the ID of an already existing 'Geology (Science)' category entity.)
</p>
<p>
    Submit this entity and see that the full title of the resulting entity
    now has a clickable version of 'Geology' in it!
</p>
<p>
    We are thus able to use, not just plain words, but also <i>other
    entities</i> when we construct new entities!
    Whenever you choose to fill in an entity ID of the form '#1234' (i.e. with
    '#' followed by decimal digits) in a submission field of such a template,
    the entity with that ID will be inserted instead in the title of the
    resulting entity.
</p>
<p>
    This fact is also what makes us able to construct statements about entities,
    which can then be rated on a scale from 0 to 10 as we will see in the next
    lesson.
</p>
<p>
    As some final points of this lesson, note the first of all that all
    your newly created (or successfully searched for) entities have 'Category ▸'
    as the first part of their full title, meaning that they have the type
    'Category.' Note also that in the column of the '{&lt;Title&gt;}
    (&lt;Supercategory&gt;)' template, it says: 'Type of derived entities:
    Category.' This indeed means that all the entities created from (or
    'derived from') this template will get the type 'Category,' like yours did.
    All templates have an associated type like this.
</p>
<p>
    And second of all, note that the '{&lt;Title&gt;} (&lt;Supercategory&gt;)'
    template has curly brackets around '&lt;Title&gt;.' This tells the web
    application that it should only print out the '&lt;Title&gt;' part as the
    entity's title, except when it comes to the so-called 'full title.'
</p>
<p>
    This is why we for instance only see 'Rock' printed out in the Subcategories
    tab of music, rather than 'Rock (Music),' and it is also why the full title
    of the most recently submitted 'Rock (Geology)' entity (the one with the
    clickable 'Geology') is printed out as 'Category ▸ Rock (Geology),' and not
    'Category ▸ Rock (Geology (Science)).'
</p>


<h3>Lesson 3</h3>
<p>
    Make sure that you are still logged in, since now we are going to rate some
    entities!
</p>
<p>
    Open the initial 'Entities' column, and perhaps close all other columns,
    if you like.
</p>
<p>
    Click the dropdown button (the downward arrowhead) just under 'Music' in
    the Subcategories tab.
</p>
<p>
    Note the green rating bar (which appears only if you are logged in).
    It runs from 0.1 to 10 in increments of 0.1.
</p>
<p>
    Imagine that this will be replaced with a line of ten stars in a near-future
    implementation of this site. These stars will be filled up with yellow from
    left to right until the (fractional) point of the chosen rating. But for
    now, please excuse this boring green bar as a placeholder for these stars.
</p>
<p>
    Click the right end of the rating bar such that the value says 10, and then
    click 'Submit' to submit your first rating!
</p>
<p>
    Now try to refresh the tab by clicking the close button up in the tab, then
    click the tab again. Note that the 'Music' entity that you just rated is at
    the top! This is because the application is set to prioritize your own
    ratings (rather than an average) in whatever set of entities that you view
    on the site (such as the set of 'Subcategores of Entities' in this
    instance).
</p>
<p>
    Now try to change the rating of 'Music' from 10 to 9.5, again by clicking
    the dropdown button under 'Music' and adjust the rating bar before clicking
    'Submit.'
    And before refreshing the page, give 'Movies' and 'Science' a full rating
    score of 10 as well.
    When you now refresh the tab, 'Movies' and 'Science' should be at the very
    top, and 'Music' should be somewhere close below them.
</p>
<p>
    Let us keep the ratings this way, because it helps the next users that want
    to follow this tutorial that these entities stays close to the top of this
    list. Please also click on 'Music' and give
    'Rock' a high rating score under the Subcategories tab for the sake of
    others doing Lesson 1 and 2 after you.
</p>
<p>
    Feel free to also up-rate some other genres of music under the Subcategories
    tab of the 'Music' column, like e.g. 'Jazz' or 'Pop.' And potentially also
    up-rate some other kinds of useful subcategories that a user browsing for
    things related to 'Music' might interested in, such as e.g. 'Musicology.'
</p>
<p>
    You can also down-rate any unfitting or malformed subcategories in the
    lists if you like.
</p>


<h3>Lesson 4</h3>
<p>
    To reflect on what you have just rated, click the dropdown button again
    under 'Music' in the 'Entities' column (if the dropdown menu is not already
    extended), then click on 'Subcategories of Entities.'
</p>
<p>
    Note from this entity's full title that it is also of the type 'Category.'
    Then try to click on the 'Instances' tab to see what hides under there.
</p>
<p>
    You should now see that the set of entities under this tab is exactly the
    same as the set under the Subcategories tab in the 'Entities' column (at
    least if you refresh the latter)!
</p>
<p>
    So when you gave your ratings under the Subcategories tab of the 'Entities'
    column, you more precisely rated that the relevant entities ('Music',
    'Movies,' 'Science') are instances of the category 'Subcategories of
    Entities.'
</p>
<p>
    In fact, all statements that you rate on the site is 'phrased' this way:
    by taking a category and saying that a given other entity is an instance
    of that category. The rating scale then represents how useful/important the
    given entity is as an instance of the given category.
</p>
<p>
    So when you gave the high rating scores to 'Music', 'Movies,' and 'Science'
    under the Subcategories tab in the last lesson, you more precisely rated
    that these three categories <i>are very important/useful entities</i> of the
    category of all <i>subcategories of the 'Entities' category.</i>
</p>
<p>
    It is not hard to convince oneself that all statements can be rephrased in
    such a way, namely as a category–instance relation. For instance, if we
    want to say that a given movie is very scary, we can first construct a
    category of scary movies, and then rate the given movie highly as an
    instance of that category.
</p>
<p>
    For any such category that represents a predicate, like 'scary' or 'funny'
    and so on, the rating scale is then naturally interpreted as saying
    <i>how</i> e.g. scary or funny the category's instances are.
</p>
<p>
    We will try to rate some predicates this way for some movies in the next
    lesson!
</p>


<h3>Lesson 5</h3>
<p>
    Go to the 'Entities' column and click on 'Movies' to open that category
    entity in a new column.
</p>
<p>
    Click the Instances tab to see some instances of this category, i.e. some
    movie entities.
</p>
<p>
    Find and click on 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,' but
    not before giving it a high rating as an instance of this 'Movies' category,
    which can be done by again clicking the little dropdown button underneath
    it, and then adjusting the rating bar all the way to the right before
    clicking 'Submit.'
</p>
<p>
    Note that by submitting this rating, you do <i>not</i> state the this movie
    is necessarily a <i>good</i> movie, but only that it is an important/useful
    instance of the 'Movies' category, and that you thus think that other users
    might be interested to see it near the top when they open the same tab.
</p>
<p>
    When you have opened 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' in
    a new column, note first of all that its type is 'Movie.' You might also
    note that there are fewer tabs in this column than there are for columns of
    entities with the type 'Category.'
</p>
<p>
    The column should have opened the 'Info' tab initially. If you want to, try
    to click on some of the properties below like 'Director(s)' or 'Actors' to
    see what hides under them. If you go to the 'Director(s)' property and see
    other names than 'Peter Jackson,' feel free to up-rate 'Peter Jackson' and
    down-rate all others.
</p>
<p>
    But this is not why we are here now. Go instead to the 'Ratings' tab (of
    'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'). You should now see at
    least four predicates that can be rated under this tab, e.g. 'Good,' 'Scary,'
    'Funny' and/or 'Iconic.'
</p>
<p>
    Now rate as many of these predicates as you like! (Remember to click
    'Submit' for each rating in order to finalize it.)
</p>
<p>
    Once you have done this, try to refresh the tab. You should see that the
    order of these predicates do <i>not</i> change according to their values.
    This is because the importance of a predicate is not necessarily
    proportional to how highly it is rated. It might be equally important to see
    some predicates that are rated very lowly for the given entity.
</p>
<p>
    In order to rate and adjust the order of these predicates, press the
    little dropdown button (with a faint bluish background) at the top of the
    list. There you should see two categories: 'Relevant categories to rate of
    The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' and 'Relevant categories
    to rate for type instances of Movie.'
</p>
<p>
    Let us click the latter one in order to rate what predicates/categories are
    relevant to rate for movies in general, and not just this specific one.
</p>
<p>
    Under the 'Instances' tab of the column of 'Relevant categories to rate for
    type instances of Movie,' you should see at least some of the categories
    that you saw under the 'Ratings' tab before.
</p>
<p>
    Give one of these categories you own rating (remember to click 'Submit'),
    then go back to the Ratings tab under 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship
    of the Ring,' refresh it, and see how the order of the predicates have
    changed!
</p>
<p>
    Go back again to the 'Relevant categories to rate for type instances of
    Movie' column and rate some more of these predicates, then repeat the
    process to see the order changed again under the given Ratings tab.
</p>


<h3>Lesson 6</h3>
<p>
    <i>
        This lesson is no longer correct, since 'Good' and 'Scary' etc. are
        now just simple categories with no context. <br>
        TODO: Change this lesson.
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    Let us now add our own predicates/categories to this list!
</p>
<p>
    First make sure that you again have the 'The Lord of the Rings: The
    Fellowship of the Ring' and the 'Relevant categories to rate for type
    instances of Movie' columns open (preferably side by side).
</p>
<p>
    Press e.g. 'Good Movies' to open that in a new column, then press the
    '&lt;Adjective phrase&gt; &lt;Category&gt;' template of that column. Now
    close the 'Good Movies' column, and perhaps click the plus button (from
    Lesson 0) to get three columns on screen if your screen is wide enough for
    that.
</p>
<p>
    In the column of '&lt;Adjective phrase&gt; &lt;Category&gt;,' type in '#31'
    (the ID of the 'Movies' category) in the 'Category' field under the 'Submit
    entity' tab. Then type in whatever adjective (phrase) you like in the
    'Adjective phrase' field! (You might want to choose one that is relevant for
    movies.) Now submit that entity!
</p>
<p>
    In the new column that opens up, note the ID of this (potentially brand new)
    entity. Now go back to the 'Relevant categories to rate for type instances
    of Movie' column and select the 'Submit instance' tab.
</p>
<p>
    Type in the ID number (without the '#') of your new entity in the ID field
    and click 'Submit.' This should bring up a rating bar ending in '(applies to
    <i>&lt;Your chosen adjective&gt;</i> Movies).'
</p>
<p>
    This submission is not finalized before you submit a rating, so adjust this
    bar (give it a high rating, why not!) and click 'Submit!'
</p>
<p>
    Finally, go back to the 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'
    column, refresh the Ratings tab, and find your own new predicate/category
    on the list! And to finish this lesson off, give this new predicate the
    rating that you see fitting!
</p>

<h3>Lesson 7</h3>
<p>
    As a last quick lesson, if you want to submit your own types, go to the
    'Type' type entity, which can e.g. be reached by clicking on 'Category' in
    the full title of the 'Entities' column, then clicking 'Type' in the full
    title of this 'Category' column. And in this 'Type' column, select the
    'Submit entity' tab
</p>
<p>
    Here you can submit your own type, e.g. a 'Video' type by typing in 'Video'
    as the 'Title' and submitting it. (Note the singular nouns are preferred for
    types.)
</p>
<p>
    And if you want to submit a template for your new type, the easiest way is
    to select the 'Submit template' tab in the column of this type entity (in
    the column that just opened after your submission).
    You can then try to copy the syntax of the other templates that you have
    seen. By the way, a good template format for concrete types such as e.g.
    'Movie,' 'Video,' 'Person' etc. is this:<br>'{&lt;Title&gt;},
    &lt;Defining property 1&gt;, &lt;Defining property 2&gt;, ...'
</p>


<h3>Tutorial complete!</h3>
<p>
    This completes the tutorial!
</p>
<p>
    Feel free to play around, e.g. with adding your own movies, or even adding
    other kinds of types (and templates)!
</p>
<p>
    You can also investigate the Info page of 'The Lord of the Rings: The
    Fellowship of the Ring' further to see how this works. Hint: It works a lot
    like the Ratings tab (in terms of which properties appear in the tab).
</p>
<p>
    This tutorial will be updated with new stuff when it gets implemented, such
    as e.g. the ability to sort category sets with respect to arbitrary
    predicates!

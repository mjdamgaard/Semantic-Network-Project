/* Semantic inputs */

/* Semantic inputs are the statements that the users (or aggregation bots) give
 * as input to the semantic network. A central feature of this semantic system
 * is that all such statements come with a numerical value which represents the
 * degree to which the user deems that the statement is correct (like when
 * answering a survey).
 * The statements in this system are always formed from a tag entity and an
 * instance entity. The user thus states that the latter is an instance of the
 * given tag. The rating then tells how well the tag first the instance.

## UPA saved modules

This folder is intended for special modules that UPA\_modules.php does not have
to query from the database, but can read directly from this folder instead.

Especially, this folder is intended to include all (non-deprecated) basic
modules with all the developer-defined functions from which the users
build all their functions.
